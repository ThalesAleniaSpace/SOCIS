# ESA - Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS)
## [Portable AI solutions for test results analysis - (B12)](https://socis.esa.int/projects/)



##### Objective

Implement a CNN to work on the outputs ( the graphical images ) of the test results generated from Thales Alenia Space Espa√±a test benches during equipment acceptance campaigns by outputting 3 different values namely current_stabilised_value (mA), current_max/min_value (mA), current_rise/fall_time_spec (mS).

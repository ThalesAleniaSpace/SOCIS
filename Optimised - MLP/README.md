# ESA - Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS)
## [Portable AI solutions for test results analysis - (B12)](https://socis.esa.int/projects/)



##### Objective

The main goal is to train, configure and deploy a perceptron to work on the outputs of the test results generated from Thales Alenia Space Espa√±a test benches during equipment acceptance campaigns by outputting 4 different values namely current_stabilised_value (mA), current_max/min_value (mA), power_state, current_rise/fall_time_spec (mS).

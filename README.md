# ESA - Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS)
## [Portable AI solutions for test results analysis - (B12)](https://socis.esa.int/projects/)

##### Scope

The main goal of this project is to train, configure and deploy two deep neural network (a perceptron and a Convolutional Neural Network - (CNN)) in a portable VPU to validate its performances, behavior and integration capacity. The proof of concept will be based on pattern recognition on test results.

---

##### Duration

The project will take place between June and September 2019 and it is divided in 6 sprints of 2 weeks each.

---

##### Sprints

The sprints will be updated when the actual sprint is finished.
* Sprint 1:

  * Technology studying and installing
    * Python 3.7
    * Tensorflow/Keras
    * Jupyter Notebook
    * Docker
  * Input data analysis
    * Analysis of input data
    * Understanding of the data and its categorization
    * Plan how the data will be used
    * Transform the data (if needed) to be used in the network.

* Sprint 2:
  * Implementation of perceptron
    * 4 point solution (ON Graphs)
    * 4 point solution (OFF Graphs)
    * Reduction of points solution (ON graphs)
    * Reduction of points solution (ON graphs)
  * Analyze and optimize the networks
    * Analyze the 2 different solutions
    * Trade off
    * Optimize topology and parameters

* **Sprint 3** -> Actual sprint

* Sprint 4

* Sprint 5

* Sprint 6
